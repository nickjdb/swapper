description: A sturdy cabin with lots of natural light, right in a flowerful garden. It will feel like living outdoors, while inside the cabin there is a lingering aroma of larix wood and crackling of the woodstove. This charming garden room has a 180 degrees garden view, with large windows in the front and in the roof. (Full length curtains for the windows allow for privacy.
local-area: The location is in the largest natural area of the Netherlands. The area is great for both walking and bicycling (if you did not bring your own, we have two you can borrow). Many short and long walking and biking routes through heathlands, woods and meadows start within a kilometer from the house. Also within walking distance (800 meter) are the town centre (with shops and several decent restaurants) and swimming pool. Lakes (including beaches) are 5 kilometers away. Because of the central location of the town, many relevant cities are easily reachable. Neighbouring the town is a smaller historic city, Harderwijk (5 kilometers). Zwolle, Amersfoort and Apeldoorn are a half hour drive. Amsterdam is a one hour drive. Your vehicle can be parked in our own driveway. We are also easily reachable by public transportation. The train station is a 12 minute walk away, the nearest bus stop is around the corner.
