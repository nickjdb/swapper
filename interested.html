    <h3 class="dropdown-section-1"> Reservation request </h3>
    <div class="dropdown-section-content-1 questions">
    <div class="dropdown-nav">
      <span> How do I check the status of my booking? </span>
      <div class="dropdown-content">
        <p> When a host accepts your request, you'll receive an email and, depending on your account notification settings, a text (SMS) and push notification from Swapac. Your reservation request status will also change to Accepted. </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="dropdown-nav">
      <span> Should I book if I have not heard back from the host? </span>
      <div class="dropdown-content">
        <p> Once you’ve found a listing for your trip, we recommend messaging the host to doublecheck the availability of the space for your dates.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="dropdown-nav">
      <span> Why is my credit card getting declined? </span>
      <div class="dropdown-content">
        <p> Credit cards can be declined for a number of reasons. Swapac generally isn't notified of the specific reason.

Common issues
Check that you're entering your credit card number and billing address correctly, that your card has available funds, and that your card hasn't expired.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="dropdown-nav">
      <span> How do I submit a reservation request? </span>
      <div class="dropdown-content">
        <p> If you’re ready to book a place on Swapac, you can send a request to the host to book a reservation. If you’re unsure about the listing or its availability, you can also send a message to the host.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="dropdown-nav">
      <span> What happens if my reservation request is declined or expires? </span>
      <div class="dropdown-content">
        <p> If your reservation request is declined by the host or expires, meaning the host didn’t respond within 24 hours, no charge is made for the reservation and you’re free to book with another host.

We urge our hosts to keep their calendars up to date and respond to requests in a timely manner. But, sometimes situations come up that prevent this from happening.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="dropdown-nav">
      <span> Can I make changes to a pending reservation request? </span>
      <div class="dropdown-content">
        <p> Yes. If the request hasn’t been accepted by the host, you can cancel the request and send a new one with the updated reservation details.</p>

    <span> How do I edit or remove my payment method? </span>
    <div class="dropdown-content">
      <p> If you choose to pay with a credit card when you make a reservation request, you can edit or remove the credit card information from your Swapac account later, as long as a default payment method remains. </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="dropdown-nav">
    <span> How do I use Alipay to pay? </span>
    <div class="dropdown-content">
      <p> Alipay is available as a payment method for guests in China who are booking Swapac reservations less than 28 nights long.

When you submit a reservation request and choose to use Alipay, you'll be redirected to the Alipay website. You'll need to log in to Alipay to make your payment.

Once your payment for the full amount of the reservation is complete, the reservation request is sent to the host, who will have up to 24 hours to reply.

If your request is accepted, you'll be able to access your billing receipt and trip itinerary.

If your request is retracted, declined, or expires, your Alipay account will automatically be refunded in full. Refunds can take up to 5 business days to reflect in your Alipay account.</p>
    </div>

  <div class="dropdown-nav">
    <span> How can I add a guest or business address to my receipt? </span>
    <div class="dropdown-content">
      <p> After you’ve booked a reservation, you can add guest names and a business address to your billing receipt. You can edit your business address at any time, but you can't edit the guest names after the reservation ends.

Information like passport numbers, birthdates, and tax identification numbers can’t be added to a receipt. </p>
